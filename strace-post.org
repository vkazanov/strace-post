  - tracing syscalls in original UNIX-like systems?

  - read the memoirs!

  - links to sources

  - Unix v6 had a first mention of ptrace (http://man.cat-v.org/unix-6th/2/ptrace)

    debuggers only? any other tools using it in v6?

  - The Design of the Unix Operating System (1986) already contains ptrace (with an example)

    covers System V Release 2 (1984 release)

  - strace in Linux

  - ptrace syscall history

  - ptrace introduction to Linux

  - wikipedia: many relevant historical links

  - wikipedia: advanced features such as fault injection

  - similar tools on other systems (truss in SysV rel.4)

  - ftrace as a kernel-side traces

  - Kerrisk on strace: http://man7.org/conf/ndctechtown2018/system_call_tracing_with_strace-NDC-TechTown-Kerrisk.pdf

  - quick review http://www.osreviews.net/reviews/admin/strace

* TODO Использование strace

  - Linux/UNIX System Programming Course Examples are very good

  - other advanced examples

  - mention Michael's course

  - add terminal session gifs! accompany with code to make it easy to copy. Or just links to the
    github repo. (ttyrec then seq2gif < ttyrecord > ttyrecord.gif)

  - basic things:

    - run with strace

    - attach

    - multithreaded apps

  - man examples

  - TLPI examples

  - флаги, управляющие вывод программы

  - ptrace

  - ps shows a traced flag as in SysV? i think it's T

  - ptrace is on per-thread basis, there's no generic process, just a main thread, multiple threads
    or multiple processes each containing multiple threads.
